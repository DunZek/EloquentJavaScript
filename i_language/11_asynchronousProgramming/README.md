# Chapter 11: Asynchronous Programming
> "Who can wait quietly while the mud settles?

- The *processor* is the thing that carries out the individual sequential instructions of our programs.
- Processors are kept busy processing programs. How long until a program finishes entirely depends on the processor's own speed.
- The operating system employs multiple processors to do different various programs instead of idling them all except for one.
- It's important that we however be able to use multiple processors for one program.

## Asynchronicity
- *synchronous* programming models perform sequentially, and only sequentially.
- *asynchronous* models enable different programs or different parts of one to run simultaneously.
- *Threads*, running programs, can be used interleaved with other threads with multiple processors to perform multiple tasks, synchronizing with other threads afterwards in a synchronous execution model.
