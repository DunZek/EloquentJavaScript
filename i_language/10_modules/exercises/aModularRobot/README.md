# A Modular Robot
> Main app: `main.js`

Rewrite the project of chapter 7 as a modular program:
- What modules to create?
- Which module would depend on another?
- How would each module interface?
- Which pieces could be a prewritten NPM package?
- Write these parts or replace it with an NPM package?

- Chapter 7 writes about the following bindings:
    - `roads`
    - `buildGraph`
    - `roadGraph`
    - `VillageState`
    - `runRobot`
    - `randomPick`
    - `randomRobot`
    - `mailRoute`
    - `routeRobot`
    - `findRoute`
    - `goalOrientedRobot`
